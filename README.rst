**CKAN is the worldâ€™s leading open-source data portal platform**.
CKAN makes it easy to publish, share and work with data. It's a data management
system that provides a powerful platform for cataloging, storing and accessing
datasets with a rich front-end, full API (for both data and catalog), visualization
tools and more. Read more at `ckan.org <http://ckan.org/>`_.

ISEBEL infrastructure diagram
-----------------------------

ISEBEL consists of multiple components. CKAN is her data management system. Solr is the indexer, Postgre is the database server
and OAI PMH harvester manager as the harvester for the data provider. There are underlining components which is listed below:

  1. Translater which machine translates the stories (N-to-N)
  2. Extracter which extracts the keywords (so called machine generated keywords)
  3. Merger which merges the machine generated keywords with the manual keywords
  4. The importer which imports harvested data into CKAN
  5. The merger which links manual
