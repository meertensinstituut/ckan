def create(resource_id, fields, rows):
    '''
    The first row will be used to guess types not in the fields and the
    guessed types will be added to the headers permanently.
    Consecutive rows have to conform to the field definitions.

    rows can be empty so that you can just set the fields.

    fields are optional but needed if you want to do type hinting or
    add extra information for certain columns or to explicitly
    define ordering.

    eg [{"id": "dob", "label": ""Date of Birth",
         "type": "timestamp" ,"concept": "day"},
        {"name": "some_stuff": ..].

    A header items values can not be changed after it has been defined
    nor can the ordering of them be changed. They can be extended though.

    Any error results in total failure! For now pass back the actual error.
    Should be transactional.
