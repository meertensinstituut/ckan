The CKAN web interface's HTML, CSS and JavaScript is fully customizable by
creating a CKAN theme.
If you just want to do some simple customizations such as changing the title
of your CKAN site, or making some small CSS customizations,
:doc:`/getting-started` documents some simple configuration settings you can
use.
If you want more control, follow the tutorials below to learn how to develop
your custom CKAN theme.


.. note::

  Before you can start developing a CKAN theme, youâ€™ll need a working source
  install of CKAN on your system. If you don't have a CKAN source install
  already, follow the instructions in :doc:`/install-from-source` before
  continuing.
