====================================
Installing CKAN using a Docker image
====================================

The currently recommended way to install CKAN on Docker is with `Datacats <https://github.com/datacats/datacats>`_.

.. note::
   There are legacy docker images at https://hub.docker.com/u/ckan/ which are
   not maintained. Information about them is archived here:
