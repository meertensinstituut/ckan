====================================
Installing CKAN using a Docker image
====================================

There is no 'official' Docker install of CKAN at this time.

.. note::
   There are legacy docker images at https://hub.docker.com/u/ckan/ which are
   not maintained and use out-of-date unpatched versions of CKAN. Information
   about them is archived here:
   <https://github.com/ckan/ckan/blob/4a3b375/doc/maintaining/installing/install-using-docker.rst>
