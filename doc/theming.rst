Theming
=======

The CKAN frontend can be fully customized by developing a CKAN theme.
If you just want to do some simple customizations such as changing the title
of your CKAN site, or making some small CSS customizations,
:doc:`getting-started` documents some simple configuration settings you can
use.
If you want more control, CKAN themes can customize all aspects of CKAN's
frontend, including changing any of CKAN's templates or template snippets,
adding custom snippets and helper functions, customizing CSS and JavaScript,
and adding static files such as images. Follow the tutorial below to learn how
to develop your custom CKAN theme.


----------------
Theming tutorial
----------------

This tutorial walks you through the process of creating an example CKAN theme
that demonstrates all of the main features of CKAN theming.


Installing CKAN
===============

Before you can start developing a CKAN theme, you’ll need a working source
install of CKAN on your system. If you don’t have a CKAN source install
already, follow the instructions in :doc:`install-from-source` before
continuing.

.. todo::

   Insert section about installing the extra dependencies needed for frontend
   development, and running less.


Creating a CKAN extension
=========================

A CKAN theme is simply a CKAN plugin that contains some custom templates and
static files, so before getting started on our CKAN theme we'll have to create
an extension and plugin. For a detailed explanation of the steps below, see
:doc:`extensions/tutorial`.

1. Use the ``paster create`` command to create an empty extension:

   .. parsed-literal::

      |activate|
      cd |virtualenv|/src
      paster --plugin=ckan create -t ckanext |extension_dir|

2. Create the file |plugin.py| with the following contents:

   .. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v1_empty_extension/plugin.py

3. Edit the ``entry_points`` in |setup.py|::

    entry_points='''
        [ckan.plugins]
        example_theme=ckanext.example_theme.plugin:ExampleThemePlugin
    ''',

4. Run ``python setup.py develop``:

   .. parsed-literal::

    |activate|
    cd |virtualenv|/src/|extension_dir|
    python setup.py develop

5. Add the plugin to the ``ckan.plugins`` setting in your |development.ini|
   file::

    ckan.plugins = stats text_preview recline_preview example_theme

6. Start CKAN in the development web server:

   .. parsed-literal::

    $ paster serve --reload |development.ini|
    Starting server in PID 13961.
    serving on 0.0.0.0:5000 view at http://127.0.0.1:5000

   Open the `CKAN front page`_ in your web browser.  If your plugin is in the
   :ref:`ckan.plugins` setting and CKAN starts without crashing, then your
   plugin is installed and CKAN can find it. Of course, your plugin doesn't
   *do* anything yet.


Customizing CKAN's HTML with Jinja2 templates
=============================================

Every CKAN page is generated by rendering a particular template. For each
page of a CKAN site there's a corresponding template file. For example the
front page is generated from the ``ckan/templates/home/index.html`` file, the
``/about`` page is generated from ``ckan/templates/home/about.html``, the
datasets page at ``/dataset`` is generated from
``ckan/templates/package/search.html``, etc.


.. _template overriding:

Replacing a default template file
---------------------------------

To customize pages, our plugin needs to register its own custom template
directory containing templates file that override the default ones.
Edit the |plugin.py| file that we created earlier, so that it looks like
this:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v2_empty_template/plugin.py

This new code does a few things:

1. It imports CKAN's *plugins toolkit* module:

   .. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v2_empty_template/plugin.py
      :start-after: import ckan.plugins as plugins
      :end-before: class ExampleThemePlugin(plugins.SingletonPlugin):

   The plugins toolkit is a Python module containing core functions, classes
   and exceptions for CKAN plugins to use. For more about the plugins toolkit,
   see :doc:`extensions/tutorial`.

2. It calls :py:func:`~ckan.plugins.core.implements` to declare that it
   implements the :py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.IConfigurer` plugin
   interface:

   .. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v2_empty_template/plugin.py
      :start-after: # Declare that this class implements IConfigurer.
      :end-before: def update_config(


   This tells CKAN that our
   :py:class:`~ckanext.example_theme.v2.plugin.ExampleThemePlugin` class
   implements the methods declared in the
   :py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.IConfigurer` interface. CKAN will call
   these methods of our plugin class at the appropriate times.

3. It implements the
   :py:meth:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.IConfigurer.update_config` method, which
   is the only method declared in the
   :py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.IConfigurer` interface:

   .. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v2_empty_template/plugin.py
      :pyobject: ExampleThemePlugin.update_config

   CKAN will call this method when it starts up, to give our plugin a chance to
   modify CKAN's configuration settings. Our
   :py:meth:`~ckanext.example_theme.v2.plugin.ExampleThemePlugin.update_config`
   method calls :py:func:`~ckan.plugins.toolkit.add_template_directory` to
   register its custom template directory with CKAN.
   This tells CKAN to look for template files in |templates_dir| whenever
   it renders a page. Any template file in this directory that has the same
   name as one of CKAN's default template files, will be used instead of the
   default file.

Now, let's customize the CKAN front page. We first need to discover which
template file CKAN uses to render the front page, so we can replace it.
Set :ref:`debug` to ``true`` in your |development.ini| file::

    [DEFAULT]

    # WARNING: *THIS SETTING MUST BE SET TO FALSE ON A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT*
    debug = true

Reload the `CKAN front page`_ in your browser, and you should see a *Debug*
link in the footer at the bottom of the page. Click on this link to open the
debug footer. The debug footer displays various information useful for CKAN
frontend development and debugging, including the name of the template file
that was used to render the current page:

.. todo:: Insert a screenshot of the debug link.

::

 Template name: home/index.html
 Template path: /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/ckan/templates/home/index.html

This tells us that ``home/index.html`` is the main template file used to render
the front page. The debug footer appears at the bottom of every CKAN page, and
can always be used to find the page's template, and other information about the
page.

Now let's override ``home/index.html`` using our plugins' custom ``templates``
directory. Create the |templates_dir| directory, create a ``home`` directory
inside the ``templates`` directory, and create an empty ``index.html`` file
inside the ``home`` directory:

.. parsed-literal::

   |extension_dir|/
     ckanext/
       example_theme/
         templates/
           home/
             index.html  <-- An empty file.

If you now reload the `CKAN front page`_ in your web browser, you should see
an empty page, because we've replaced the template file for the front page with
an empty file.


Jinja2
------

CKAN template files are written in the `Jinja2`_ templating language. Jinja
template files, such as our ``index.html`` file, are simply text files that,
when processed, generate any text-based output format such as ``HTML``,
``XML``, ``CSV``, etc. Most of the templates file in CKAN generate ``HTML``.

We'll introduce some Jinja2 basics below. Jinja2 templates have many more
features than these, for full details see the
`Jinja2 docs <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/>`_.


Expressions and variables
`````````````````````````

Jinja2 *expressions* are snippets of code between ``{{ ... }}`` delimiters,
when a template is rendered any expressions are evaluated and replaced with
the resulting value.

The simplest use of an expression is to display the value of a variable, for
example ``{{ foo }}`` in a template file will be replaced with the value of the
variable ``foo`` when the template is rendered.

.. _Pylons app_globals object: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pylons-webframework/en/latest/glossary.html#term-app-globals

CKAN makes a number of global variables available to all templates. One such
variable is ``app_globals``, the `Pylons app_globals object`_, which can be
used to access certain global attributes including some of the settings from
your CKAN config file. For example, to display the value of the
:ref:`ckan.site_title` setting from your config file you would put this code in
any template file:

.. todo:: Move these examples into separate files.

.. todo:: Should we be using ``app_globals`` or ``g``?

::

 <p>The title of this site is: {{ app_globals.site_title }}.</p>

.. note::

   Not all config settings are available to templates via ``app_globals``.
   The :ref:`sqlalchemy.url` setting, for example, contains your database
   password, so making that variable available to templates might be a security
   risk.

   If you've added your own custom options to your config file, these will not
   be available in ``app_globals``.

   .. todo:: Insert cross-ref to custom config options section.

.. note::

   Jinja2 expressions can do much more than print out the values of variables,
   for example
   they can call Jinja2's `global functions <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#list-of-global-functions>`_,
   CKAN's :ref:`template helper functions <template helper functions>` and any
   :ref:`custom template helper functions <custom template helper functions>`
   provided by your extension,
   and use any of the 
   `literals and operators <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#expressions>`_
   that Jinja provides.

   See :doc:`theming/variables-and-functions` for a list of variables and
   functions available to templates.


Tags
````

:ref:`ckan.site_title` is an example of a simple string variable.
Some variables, such as :ref:`ckan.plugins`, are lists, and can be looped over
using Jinja's ``{% for %}`` tag.

Jinja *tags* are snippets of code between ``{% ... %}`` delimiters that control
the logic of the template. For example, we can output a list of the currently
enabled plugins with this code in any template file:

::

  <p>The currently enabled plugins are:</p>
  <ul>
    {% for plugin in app_globals.plugins %}
      <li>{{ plugin }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

Other variables, such as :ref:`ckan.tracking_enabled`, are booleans, and can be
tested using Jinja's ``{% if %}`` tag:

::

  {% if g.tracking_enabled %}
    <p>CKAN's page-view tracking feature is enabled.</p>
  {% else %}
    <p>CKAN's page-view tracking feature is <i>not</i> enabled.</p>
  {% endif %}


Comments
````````

Finally, any text between ``{# ... #}`` delimiters in a Jinja2 template is a
*comment*, and will not be output when the template is rendered:

::

  {# This text will not appear in the output when this template is rendered. #}

.. todo::

   *  Mention what happens if you try to access a variable or attribute
      that doesn't exist.

   *  Mention filters. And can ckan template helper functions be used as
      filters?


Extending templates with ``{% ckan_extends %}``
-----------------------------------------------

CKAN provides a custom Jinja tag ``{% ckan_extends %}`` that we can use to
declare that our ``home/index.html`` template extends the default
``home/index.html`` template, instead of completely replacing it.
Edit the empty ``index.html`` file you just created, and add one line:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v3_ckan_extends/templates/home/index.html

If you now reload the `CKAN front page`_ in your browser, you should see the
normal front page appear again. When CKAN processes our ``index.html`` file,
the ``{% ckan_extends %}`` tag tells it to process the default
``home/index.html`` file first.


Replacing template blocks with ``{% block %}``
----------------------------------------------

Jinja templates can contain *blocks* that child templates can override.  For
example, CKAN's default ``home/index.html`` template has a block that contains
the Jinja and HTML code for the "featured groups" that appear on the front page
by default::

  {% block secondary_content %}
    <div class="row group-listing">
        {% for group in c.group_package_stuff %}
        <div class="span6">
            <div class="box">
            {% snippet 'snippets/group_item.html', group=group.group_dict,
                       truncate=50, truncate_title=35 %}
            </div>
        </div>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
  {% endblock %}

.. todo::

   Fix ``c.group_package_stuff`` above (stupid name).

.. todo:: Insert screenshot of the part of the page that this template renders?

When a custom template file extends one of CKAN's default template files using
``{% ckan_extends %}``, it can replace any of the blocks from the default
template with its own code by using ``{% block %}``. Edit your ``index.html``
file again and change the contents to:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v4_block/templates/home/index.html

Reload the `CKAN front page`_ in your browser.
You should see that the featured groups section of the page has been replaced,
but the rest of the page remains intact.

.. todo::

   Explain how to find out what blocks a given template provides.
   Do you have to just look at the source?


Extending parent blocks with Jinja's ``{{ super() }}``
------------------------------------------------------

If you want to add some code to a block but don't want to replace the entire
block, you can use Jinja's ``{{ super() }}`` tag:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v5_super/templates/home/index.html

When the child block above is rendered, Jinja will replace the
``{{ super() }}`` tag with the contents of the parent block.
The ``{{ super() }}`` tag can be placed anywhere in the block.


.. _template helper functions:

Template helper functions
-------------------------

Now let's put some interesting content into our custom template block.
One way for templates to get content out of CKAN is by calling CKAN's
*template helper functions*.

For example, let's replace the featured groups on the front page with an
activity stream of the site's recently created, updated and deleted datasets.
Change the code in |index.html| to this:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v6_helper_function/templates/home/index.html

Reload the `CKAN front page`_ in your browser and you should see a new activity
stream.

To call a template helper function we use a Jinja2 *expression* (code wrapped
in ``{{ ... }}`` brackets), and we use the global variable ``h`` (available
to all templates) to access the helper:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v6_helper_function/templates/home/index.html
   :start-after: {% block secondary_content %}
   :end-before: {% endblock %}

To see what other template helper functions are available, look at the
:doc:`template helper functions reference docs <template-helper-functions>`.


.. _custom template helper functions:

Adding your own template helper functions
-----------------------------------------

Plugins can add their own template helper functions by implementing CKAN's
:py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.ITemplateHelpers` plugin interface.
(see :doc:`extensions/tutorial` for a detailed explanation of CKAN plugins and
plugin interfaces).

Let's add another item to our custom front page: a "dataset of the day". We'll
add a custom template helper function to select the dataset to be shown.
First, in our ``plugin.py`` file we need to implement
:py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.ITemplateHelpers` and provide our helper
function. Change the contents of ``plugin.py`` to look like this:

.. todo: This probably breaks when the site has no datasets.

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v7_custom_helper_function/plugin.py

We've added a number of new features to ``plugin.py``. First, we defined a
function to get the dataset of the day from CKAN:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v7_custom_helper_function/plugin.py
   :pyobject: dataset_of_the_day

This function uses CKAN's *action functions* to get the dataset from CKAN.
See :doc:`extensions/tutorial` for more about action functions.

Next, we called :py:func:`~ckan.plugins.implements` to declare that your class
now implements :py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.ITemplateHelpers`:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v7_custom_helper_function/plugin.py
   :start-after: # Declare that this plugin will implement ITemplateHelpers.
   :end-before: def update_config(self, config):

Finally, we implemented the
:py:meth:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.ITemplateHelpers.get_helpers` method from
:py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.ITemplateHelpers` to register our function
as a template helper:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v7_custom_helper_function/plugin.py
   :pyobject: ExampleThemePlugin.get_helpers

Now that we've registered our helper function, we need to call it from our
template. As with CKAN's default template helpers, templates access custom
helpers via the global variable ``h``.
Edit |index.html| to look like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v7_custom_helper_function/templates/home/index.html

Now reload your `CKAN front page`_ in your browser. You should see the title of
a random dataset appear on the page, and each time you reload the page you'll
get a different name.

Simply displaying the title of a dataset isn't very good. We want the dataset
to be hyperlinked to its page, and also to show some other information
about the dataset such as its notes and file formats. To display our dataset of
the day nicely, we'll use CKAN's *template snippets*.


Template snippets
-----------------

*Template snippets* are small snippets of template code that, just like helper
functions, can be called from any template file. To call a snippet, you use
another of CKAN's custom Jinja2 tags: ``{% snippet %}``. CKAN comes with a
selection of snippets, which you can find in the various ``snippets``
directories in ``ckan/templates/``, such as ``ckan/templates/snippets/``
and ``ckan/templates/package/snippets/``.

.. todo::

   Autodoc all the default snippets, link to reference docs.

For example, ``ckan/templates/snippets/package_item.html`` is a snippet that
renders a dataset nicely. The default CKAN templates use this snippet whenever
they want to show a list of packages, for example on the datasets page,
a group's page, an organization's page or a user's page:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckan/templates/snippets/package_item.html
   :end-before: #}

.. todo:: Fix this docstring.

Let's change our |index.html| file to call this snippet:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v8_snippet/templates/home/index.html

Here we pass two arguments to the ``{% snippet %}`` tag:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v8_snippet/templates/home/index.html
   :start-after: {# Call the package_item.html snippet. #}
   :end-before: {% endblock %}

the first argument is the name of the snippet file to call. The second
argument, separated by a comma, is the package to pass into the snippet.  After
the filename you can pass any number of variables into a snippet, and these
will all be available to the snippet code as top-level global variables.  As in
the ``package_item.html`` docstring above, each snippet's docstring should
document the parameters it requires.

If you reload your `CKAN front page`_ in your web browser now, you should see
the dataset of the day rendered nicely.


Adding your own template snippets
---------------------------------

Just as plugins can add their own template helper functions, they can also add
their own snippets. To add template snippets, all a plugin needs to do is add a
``snippets`` directory in its ``templates`` directory, and start adding files.
The snippets will be callable from other templates immediately.

.. note::

   For CKAN to find your plugins' snippets directories, you should already have
   added your plugin's custom template directory to CKAN, see :ref:`template
   overriding`.

Let's create a custom snippet to display our dataset of the day, and put the
``<h3>Dataset of the day</h3>`` heading and the code to call the helper
function to retrieve the dataset into the snippet, so that we can reuse the
whole thing on different parts of the site if we want to.

Create a new directory |snippets_dir| containing a file named
``example_theme_dataset_of_the_day.html`` with these contents:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v9_custom_snippet/templates/snippets/example_theme_dataset_of_the_day.html

As you can see, snippets can call other snippets - our custom snippet actually
calls the default snippet to render the dataset itself:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v9_custom_snippet/templates/snippets/example_theme_dataset_of_the_day.html
   :start-after: {# Call the core package_item.html snippet to render the dataset. #}
   :end-before: %}

.. todo::

   Explain the HTML and CSS being used in the snippet above, and where it comes
   from.

Now edit your |index.html| file and change it to use our new snippet instead of
the default one:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v9_custom_snippet/templates/home/index.html

.. warning::

   Default snippets can be overridden.
   If a plugin adds a snippet with the same name as one of CKAN's default
   snippets, the plugin's snippet will override the default snippet wherever
   the default snippet is used.

   Also if two plugins both have snippets with the same name, one of the
   snippets will override the other. <-- TODO: Verify whether this is true

   To avoid unintended conflicts, we recommend that snippet filenames begin
   with the name of the extension they belong to, e.g.
   ``snippets/example_theme_*.html``.

   .. todo::

      Exactly what order are ``snippets`` directories read in, and what
      overrides what?

.. note::

   Snippets don't have access to the global template context variable,
   ``c`` (see :ref:`global variables`). Snippets *can* access other
   global variables such as ``h``, ``app_globals`` and ``request``, as well as
   any variables explicitly passed into the snippet by the parent template when
   it calls the snippet with a ``{% snippet %}`` tag.


.. _global variables:

Global variables available to templates
---------------------------------------

.. _Pylons app_globals object: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pylons-webframework/en/latest/glossary.html#term-app-globals

CKAN passes a number of variables that templates can use in Jinja statements or
expressions. For example, one such variable is ``app_globals``, the `Pylons
app_globals object`_, which can be used to access global attributes including
the config settings from the CKAN config file.

.. todo:: Move these examples into a separate file.

.. todo:: Change this example to use custom config settings,
   dataset of the day, datasets of the day, show dataset of the day.

::

    {% ckan_extends %}

    {% block secondary_content %}

      <p>Site title: {{ g.site_title }}</p>

    {% endblock %}

``{{ g.site_title }}`` will output the :ref:`ckan.site_title` setting from your
config file (a string) into the web page.

Some variables, such as :ref:`ckan.plugins`, are lists. We can use a
``{% for %}`` loop to print out the list of currently enabled plugins::

    <p>Plugins enabled:</p>
    <ul>
    {% for plugin in g.plugins %}
        <li>{{ plugin }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

.. todo:: Mention what happens if you try to access a variable or attribute
   that doesn't exist.

.. todo:: Mention filters. And can ckan template helper functions be used as
   filters?

.. todo:: Mention tests.

The following global variables are available to all templates:

.. todo::

   Add explanation of template variables and examples of how to use them in
   Jinja2 templates.


``c``
 ``pylons.util.AttribSafeContextObj``

 Using this is discouraged, better to use ``h``.
 ``c`` is not available to snippets (but I think the rest are?)

``h``
 ``ckan.config.environment._Helpers`` object

``app_globals``
 ``ckan.lib.app_globals._Globals`` object

``request``
 ``Request`` object

``response``
 ``Response`` object

 .. todo:: Remove this? Doesn't appear to be used.

``session``

``actions``
 class ``ckan.model.authz.Action``

 .. todo:: Remove this? Doesn't appear to be used and doesn't look like
           something we want.
