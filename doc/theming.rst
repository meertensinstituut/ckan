Theming
=======

The CKAN frontend can be fully customized by developing a CKAN theme.
If you just want to do some simple customizations such as changing the title
of your CKAN site, or making some small CSS customizations,
:doc:`getting-started` documents some simple configuration settings you can
use.
If you want more control, CKAN themes can customize all aspects of CKAN's
frontend, including changing any of CKAN's templates or template snippets,
adding custom snippets and helper functions, customizing CSS and JavaScript,
and adding static files such as images. Follow the tutorial below to learn how
to develop your custom CKAN theme.


----------------
Theming tutorial
----------------

This tutorial walks you through the process of creating an example CKAN theme
that demonstrates all of the main features of CKAN theming.


Installing CKAN
===============

Before you can start developing a CKAN theme, you’ll need a working source
install of CKAN on your system. If you don’t have a CKAN source install
already, follow the instructions in :doc:`install-from-source` before
continuing.

.. todo::

   Insert section about installing the extra dependencies needed for frontend
   development, and running less.


Creating a CKAN extension
=========================

A CKAN theme is simply a CKAN plugin that contains some custom templates and
static files, so before getting started on our CKAN theme we'll have to create
an extension and plugin. For a detailed explanation of the steps below, see
:doc:`extensions/tutorial`.

1. Use the ``paster create`` command to create an empty extension:

   .. parsed-literal::

      |activate|
      cd |virtualenv|/src
      paster --plugin=ckan create -t ckanext |extension_dir|

2. Create the file |plugin.py| with the following contents:

   .. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v1_empty_extension/plugin.py

3. Edit the ``entry_points`` in |setup.py|::

    entry_points='''
        [ckan.plugins]
        example_theme=ckanext.example_theme.plugin:ExampleThemePlugin
    ''',

4. Run ``python setup.py develop``:

   .. parsed-literal::

    |activate|
    cd |virtualenv|/src/|extension_dir|
    python setup.py develop

5. Add the plugin to the ``ckan.plugins`` setting in your |development.ini|
   file::

    ckan.plugins = stats text_preview recline_preview example_theme

6. Start CKAN in the development web server:

   .. parsed-literal::

    $ paster serve --reload |development.ini|
    Starting server in PID 13961.
    serving on 0.0.0.0:5000 view at http://127.0.0.1:5000

   Open the `CKAN front page`_ in your web browser.  If your plugin is in the
   :ref:`ckan.plugins` setting and CKAN starts without crashing, then your
   plugin is installed and CKAN can find it. Of course, your plugin doesn't
   *do* anything yet.


Customizing CKAN's HTML with Jinja2 templates
=============================================

Every CKAN page is generated by rendering a particular template. For each
page of a CKAN site there's a corresponding template file. For example the
front page is generated from the ``ckan/templates/home/index.html`` file, the
``/about`` page is generated from ``ckan/templates/home/about.html``, the
datasets page at ``/dataset`` is generated from
``ckan/templates/package/search.html``, etc.


.. _template overriding:

Replacing a default template file
---------------------------------

To customize pages, our plugin needs to register its own custom template
directory containing templates file that override the default ones.
Edit the |plugin.py| file that we created earlier, so that it looks like
this:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v2_empty_template/plugin.py

This new code does a few things:

1. It imports CKAN's *plugins toolkit* module:

   .. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v2_empty_template/plugin.py
      :start-after: import ckan.plugins as plugins
      :end-before: class ExampleThemePlugin(plugins.SingletonPlugin):

   The plugins toolkit is a Python module containing core functions, classes
   and exceptions for CKAN plugins to use. For more about the plugins toolkit,
   see :doc:`extensions/tutorial`.

2. It calls :py:func:`~ckan.plugins.core.implements` to declare that it
   implements the :py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.IConfigurer` plugin
   interface:

   .. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v2_empty_template/plugin.py
      :start-after: # Declare that this class implements IConfigurer.
      :end-before: def update_config(


   This tells CKAN that our
   :py:class:`~ckanext.example_theme.v2.plugin.ExampleThemePlugin` class
   implements the methods declared in the
   :py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.IConfigurer` interface. CKAN will call
   these methods of our plugin class at the appropriate times.

3. It implements the
   :py:meth:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.IConfigurer.update_config` method, which
   is the only method declared in the
   :py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.IConfigurer` interface:

   .. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v2_empty_template/plugin.py
      :pyobject: ExampleThemePlugin.update_config

   CKAN will call this method when it starts up, to give our plugin a chance to
   modify CKAN's configuration settings. Our
   :py:meth:`~ckanext.example_theme.v2.plugin.ExampleThemePlugin.update_config`
   method calls :py:func:`~ckan.plugins.toolkit.add_template_directory` to
   register its custom template directory with CKAN.
   This tells CKAN to look for template files in |templates_dir| whenever
   it renders a page. Any template file in this directory that has the same
   name as one of CKAN's default template files, will be used instead of the
   default file.

Now, let's customize the CKAN front page. We first need to discover which
template file CKAN uses to render the front page, so we can replace it.
Set :ref:`debug` to ``true`` in your |development.ini| file::

    [DEFAULT]

    # WARNING: *THIS SETTING MUST BE SET TO FALSE ON A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT*
    debug = true

Reload the `CKAN front page`_ in your browser, and you should see a *Debug*
link in the footer at the bottom of the page. Click on this link to open the
debug footer. The debug footer displays various information useful for CKAN
frontend development and debugging, including the name of the template file
that was used to render the current page:

.. todo:: Insert a screenshot of the debug link.

::

 Template name: home/index.html
 Template path: /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/ckan/templates/home/index.html

This tells us that ``home/index.html`` is the main template file used to render
the front page. The debug footer appears at the bottom of every CKAN page, and
can always be used to find the page's template, and other information about the
page.

Now let's override ``home/index.html`` using our plugins' custom ``templates``
directory. Create the |templates_dir| directory, create a ``home`` directory
inside the ``templates`` directory, and create an empty ``index.html`` file
inside the ``home`` directory:

.. parsed-literal::

   |extension_dir|/
     ckanext/
       example_theme/
         templates/
           home/
             index.html  <-- An empty file.

If you now reload the `CKAN front page`_ in your web browser, you should see
an empty page, because we've replaced the template file for the front page with
an empty file.


Jinja2
------

CKAN template files are written in the `Jinja2`_ templating language. Jinja
template files, such as our ``index.html`` file, are simply text files that,
when processed, generate any text-based output format such as ``HTML``,
``XML``, ``CSV``, etc. Most of the templates file in CKAN generate ``HTML``.

We'll introduce some Jinja2 basics below. Jinja2 templates have many more
features than these, for full details see the
`Jinja2 docs <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/>`_.


.. _expressions and variables:

Expressions and variables
`````````````````````````

Jinja2 *expressions* are snippets of code between ``{{ ... }}`` delimiters,
when a template is rendered any expressions are evaluated and replaced with
the resulting value.

The simplest use of an expression is to display the value of a variable, for
example ``{{ foo }}`` in a template file will be replaced with the value of the
variable ``foo`` when the template is rendered.

.. _Pylons app_globals object: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pylons-webframework/en/latest/glossary.html#term-app-globals

CKAN makes a number of global variables available to all templates. One such
variable is ``app_globals``, the `Pylons app_globals object`_, which can be
used to access certain global attributes including some of the settings from
your CKAN config file. For example, to display the value of the
:ref:`ckan.site_title` setting from your config file you would put this code in
any template file:

.. todo:: Move these examples into separate files.

.. todo:: Should we be using ``app_globals`` or ``g``?

::

 <p>The title of this site is: {{ app_globals.site_title }}.</p>

.. note::

   Not all config settings are available to templates via ``app_globals``.
   The :ref:`sqlalchemy.url` setting, for example, contains your database
   password, so making that variable available to templates might be a security
   risk.

   If you've added your own custom options to your config file, these will not
   be available in ``app_globals``.

   .. todo:: Insert cross-ref to custom config options section.

.. note::

   Jinja2 expressions can do much more than print out the values of variables,
   for example
   they can call Jinja2's `global functions <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#list-of-global-functions>`_,
   CKAN's :ref:`template helper functions <template helper functions>` and any
   :ref:`custom template helper functions <custom template helper functions>`
   provided by your extension,
   and use any of the 
   `literals and operators <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#expressions>`_
   that Jinja provides.

   See :doc:`theming/variables-and-functions` for a list of variables and
   functions available to templates.


Tags
````

:ref:`ckan.site_title` is an example of a simple string variable.
Some variables, such as :ref:`ckan.plugins`, are lists, and can be looped over
using Jinja's ``{% for %}`` tag.

Jinja *tags* are snippets of code between ``{% ... %}`` delimiters that control
the logic of the template. For example, we can output a list of the currently
enabled plugins with this code in any template file:

::

  <p>The currently enabled plugins are:</p>
  <ul>
    {% for plugin in app_globals.plugins %}
      <li>{{ plugin }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

Other variables, such as :ref:`ckan.tracking_enabled`, are booleans, and can be
tested using Jinja's ``{% if %}`` tag:

::

  {% if g.tracking_enabled %}
    <p>CKAN's page-view tracking feature is enabled.</p>
  {% else %}
    <p>CKAN's page-view tracking feature is <i>not</i> enabled.</p>
  {% endif %}


Comments
````````

Finally, any text between ``{# ... #}`` delimiters in a Jinja2 template is a
*comment*, and will not be output when the template is rendered:

::

  {# This text will not appear in the output when this template is rendered. #}

.. todo::

   *  Mention what happens if you try to access a variable or attribute
      that doesn't exist.

   *  Mention filters. And can ckan template helper functions be used as
      filters?


Extending templates with ``{% ckan_extends %}``
-----------------------------------------------

CKAN provides a custom Jinja tag ``{% ckan_extends %}`` that we can use to
declare that our ``home/index.html`` template extends the default
``home/index.html`` template, instead of completely replacing it.
Edit the empty ``index.html`` file you just created, and add one line:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v3_ckan_extends/templates/home/index.html

If you now reload the `CKAN front page`_ in your browser, you should see the
normal front page appear again. When CKAN processes our ``index.html`` file,
the ``{% ckan_extends %}`` tag tells it to process the default
``home/index.html`` file first.


Replacing template blocks with ``{% block %}``
----------------------------------------------

Jinja templates can contain *blocks* that child templates can override.  For
example, CKAN's default ``home/index.html`` template has a block that contains
the Jinja and HTML code for the "featured groups" that appear on the front page
by default::

  {% block secondary_content %}
    <div class="row group-listing">
        {% for group in c.group_package_stuff %}
        <div class="span6">
            <div class="box">
            {% snippet 'snippets/group_item.html', group=group.group_dict,
                       truncate=50, truncate_title=35 %}
            </div>
        </div>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
  {% endblock %}

.. todo::

   Fix ``c.group_package_stuff`` above (stupid name).

.. todo:: Insert screenshot of the part of the page that this template renders?

When a custom template file extends one of CKAN's default template files using
``{% ckan_extends %}``, it can replace any of the blocks from the default
template with its own code by using ``{% block %}``. Edit your ``index.html``
file again and change the contents to:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v4_block/templates/home/index.html

Reload the `CKAN front page`_ in your browser.
You should see that the featured groups section of the page has been replaced,
but the rest of the page remains intact.

.. todo::

   Explain how to find out what blocks a given template provides.
   Do you have to just look at the source?


Extending parent blocks with Jinja's ``{{ super() }}``
------------------------------------------------------

If you want to add some code to a block but don't want to replace the entire
block, you can use Jinja's ``{{ super() }}`` tag:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v5_super/templates/home/index.html

When the child block above is rendered, Jinja will replace the
``{{ super() }}`` tag with the contents of the parent block.
The ``{{ super() }}`` tag can be placed anywhere in the block.


.. _template helper functions:

Template helper functions
-------------------------

Now let's put some interesting content into our custom template block.
One way for templates to get content out of CKAN is by calling CKAN's
*template helper functions*.

For example, let's replace the featured groups on the front page with an
activity stream of the site's recently created, updated and deleted datasets.
Change the code in |index.html| to this:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v6_helper_function/templates/home/index.html

Reload the `CKAN front page`_ in your browser and you should see a new activity
stream.

To call a template helper function we use a Jinja2 *expression* (code wrapped
in ``{{ ... }}`` brackets), and we use the global variable ``h`` (available
to all templates) to access the helper:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v6_helper_function/templates/home/index.html
   :start-after: {% block secondary_content %}
   :end-before: {% endblock %}

To see what other template helper functions are available, look at the
:doc:`template helper functions reference docs <template-helper-functions>`.


.. _custom template helper functions:

Adding your own template helper functions
-----------------------------------------

Plugins can add their own template helper functions by implementing CKAN's
:py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.ITemplateHelpers` plugin interface.
(see :doc:`extensions/tutorial` for a detailed explanation of CKAN plugins and
plugin interfaces).

Let's add another item to our custom front page: a list of the most "popular"
groups on the site (the groups with the most datasets).  We'll add a custom
template helper function to select the groups to be shown.  First, in our
``plugin.py`` file we need to implement
:py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.ITemplateHelpers` and provide our helper
function. Change the contents of ``plugin.py`` to look like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v7_custom_helper_function/plugin.py

We've added a number of new features to ``plugin.py``. First, we defined a
function to get the most popular groups from CKAN:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v7_custom_helper_function/plugin.py
   :pyobject: most_popular_groups

This function calls one of CKAN's *action functions* to get the groups from
CKAN.  See :doc:`extensions/tutorial` for more about action functions.

Next, we called :py:func:`~ckan.plugins.implements` to declare that our class
now implements :py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.ITemplateHelpers`:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v7_custom_helper_function/plugin.py
   :start-after: # Declare that this plugin will implement ITemplateHelpers.
   :end-before: def update_config(self, config):

Finally, we implemented the
:py:meth:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.ITemplateHelpers.get_helpers` method from
:py:class:`~ckan.plugins.interfaces.ITemplateHelpers` to register our function
as a template helper:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v7_custom_helper_function/plugin.py
   :pyobject: ExampleThemePlugin.get_helpers

Now that we've registered our helper function, we need to call it from our
template. As with CKAN's default template helpers, templates access custom
helpers via the global variable ``h``.
Edit |index.html| to look like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v7_custom_helper_function/templates/home/index.html

Now reload your `CKAN front page`_ in your browser. You should see a list of
the most popular groups appear on the page.

Simply displaying a list of group titles isn't very good. We want the groups to
be hyperlinked to their pages, and also to show some other information about
the group such as its description and logo image. To display our groups nicely,
we'll use CKAN's *template snippets*.


Template snippets
-----------------

*Template snippets* are small snippets of template code that, just like helper
functions, can be called from any template file. To call a snippet, you use
another of CKAN's custom Jinja2 tags: ``{% snippet %}``. CKAN comes with a
selection of snippets, which you can find in the various ``snippets``
directories in ``ckan/templates/``, such as ``ckan/templates/snippets/`` and
``ckan/templates/package/snippets/``.

.. todo::

   Autodoc all the default snippets, link to reference docs.

``ckan/templates/group/snippets/group_list.html`` is a snippet that renders a
list of groups nicely (it's used to render the groups on CKAN's ``/group`` page
and one user dashboard pages, for example):

.. literalinclude:: ../ckan/templates/group/snippets/group_list.html

(As you can see, this snippet calls another snippet, ``group_item.html``, to
render each individual group.)

Let's change our |index.html| file to call this snippet:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v8_snippet/templates/home/index.html

Here we pass two arguments to the ``{% snippet %}`` tag:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v8_snippet/templates/home/index.html
   :start-after: {# Call the group_list.html snippet. #}
   :end-before: {% endblock %}

the first argument is the name of the snippet file to call. The second
argument, separated by a comma, is the list of groups to pass into the snippet.
After the filename you can pass any number of variables into a snippet, and
these will all be available to the snippet code as top-level global variables.
As in the ``group_list.html`` docstring above, each snippet's docstring
should document the parameters it requires.

If you reload your `CKAN front page`_ in your web browser now, you should see
the dataset of the day rendered nicely.


Adding your own template snippets
---------------------------------

Just as plugins can add their own template helper functions, they can also add
their own snippets. To add template snippets, all a plugin needs to do is add a
``snippets`` directory in its ``templates`` directory, and start adding files.
The snippets will be callable from other templates immediately.

.. note::

   For CKAN to find your plugins' snippets directories, you should already have
   added your plugin's custom template directory to CKAN, see :ref:`template
   overriding`.

Let's create a custom snippet to display our most popular groups, and put the
``<h3>Most popular groups</h3>`` heading and the code to call the helper
function to retrieve the groups into the snippet, so that we can reuse the
whole thing on different parts of the site if we want to.

Create a new directory |snippets_dir| containing a file named
``example_theme_most_popular_groups.html`` with these contents:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v9_custom_snippet/templates/snippets/example_theme_most_popular_groups.html

.. todo::

   Explain the HTML and CSS being used in the snippet above, and where it comes
   from.

Now edit your |index.html| file and change it to use our new snippet instead of
the default one:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v9_custom_snippet/templates/home/index.html

.. warning::

   Default snippets can be overridden.
   If a plugin adds a snippet with the same name as one of CKAN's default
   snippets, the plugin's snippet will override the default snippet wherever
   the default snippet is used.

   Also if two plugins both have snippets with the same name, one of the
   snippets will override the other. <-- TODO: Verify whether this is true

   To avoid unintended conflicts, we recommend that snippet filenames begin
   with the name of the extension they belong to, e.g.
   ``snippets/example_theme_*.html``.

   .. todo::

      Exactly what order are ``snippets`` directories read in, and what
      overrides what?

.. note::

   Snippets don't have access to the global template context variable, ``c``
   (see :doc:`theming/variables-and-functions`). Snippets *can* access other
   global variables such as ``h``, ``app_globals`` and ``request``, as well as
   any variables explicitly passed into the snippet by the parent template when
   it calls the snippet with a ``{% snippet %}`` tag.


HTML tags and CSS classes
-------------------------

.. todo::

   We should probably remove any CSS classes from earlier examples and leave
   them unstyled, introduce CSS for the first time here.

In the custom snippet example above we used some HTML tags and CSS classes to
make the most popular groups look good and fit into the rest of the CKAN theme,
for example we used ``<div class="box">``, ``<section class="module">`` and
``<header class="module-heading">``. You might be wondering where these tags
and classes come from, and how a theme developer knows what CSS classes are
available in CKAN and what HTML and CSS they should use to make their custom
templates fit into the CKAN theme as a whole.

There are two places to look for CSS classes available in CKAN:

1. The `Bootstrap 2.3.2 docs <bootstrap>`_. All of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript
   provided by Bootstrap is available to use in CKAN.

2. CKAN's development primer page, which can be found on any CKAN site at
   ``/development/primer.html``, for example
   `demo.ckan.org/development/primer.html <http://demo.ckan.org/development/primer.html>`_.

   The primer page demonstrates many of the HTML and CSS elements available in
   CKAN, and by viewing the source of the page you can see what HTML tags and
   CSS classes they use.

.. todo::

   Insert a link to the frontend style guide when it's finished, which will
   be much better than the primer.

Let's make our recently changed datasets activity stream and most popular
groups look better by laying them out and styling them. Change your
``home/index.html`` template to look like this:

.. todo::

   This example needs fixing. The activity stream should be in a snippet like
   the groups are. The ``group_item.html`` snippet is not really meant to be
   used the way it's being used here and as a result the CSS is wrong
   (also the template crashes unless you hack it).

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v10_HTML_and_CSS/templates/home/index.html

This new template uses `Bootstrap's grid system <http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#gridSystem>`_
to layout the two main elements. Bootstrap's grid system lays out the main
elements of a page using rows and columns. You define a row with a
``<div class="row">`` tag, and then within the row you define columns with
``<div class="span6">`` tags::

    <div class="row">
      <div class="span6">
        <!-- Contents of the left column go here. -->
      </div>
      <div class="span6">
        <!-- Contents of the right column go here. -->
      </div>
    </div>

(The number in ``span6`` defines the width of the column, it can be anything
from ``span1`` to ``span12``, but all of the columns in a given row cannot add
up to more than 12.)

Within the left column, we use some CKAN CSS classes ``box``, ``module``,
``module-heading`` and ``module-content``, this uses CKAN's system of CSS
*modules* to draw the elements in nice, visually distinct sections with
associated titles::

  <div class="box">
    <section class="module">
      <header class="module-heading">
        <h3>Recent activity</h3>
      </header>
      <div class="module-content">
        {{ h.recently_changed_packages_activity_stream(limit=5) }}
      </div>
    </section>
  </div>

Change your ``snippets/example_theme_most_popular_groups.html`` template to
look like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v10_HTML_and_CSS/templates/snippets/example_theme_most_popular_groups.html

This uses the same ``box`` and ``module-heading`` classes to draw a box around
the most popular groups.

Now reload your `CKAN front page`_ in your browser, you should see the activity
stream and groups lists layed out and styled nicely.


CKAN custom Jinja2 tags reference
---------------------------------

-------------------
Adding static files
-------------------

You may need to add some custom *static files* to your CKAN site and use them
from your templates, for example image files, PDF files, or any other static
files that should be returned as-is by the webserver (as opposed to Jinja
template files, which CKAN renders before returning them to the user).

By adding a directory to CKAN's :ref:`extra_public_paths` config setting,
a plugin can make a directory of static files available to be used or linked to
by templates. Let's add a static image file, and change the home page template
to use our file as the promoted image on the front page.

.. note::

   If you're adding |javascript| or CSS files, consider using Fanstatic instead
   of :ref:`extra_public_paths`, to take advantage of extra features.
   See :ref:`fanstatic tutorial` below.

First, create a ``public`` directory in your extension with a
``promoted-image.jpg`` file in it::

 ckanext-example_theme/
   public/
     promoted-image.jpg

``promoted-image.jpg`` should be a 420x220px JPEG image file. You could use
this image file for example:

.. image:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v11_extra_public_directory/public/promoted-image.jpg
   :alt: An example promoted image
   :height: 220px
   :width: 420px

Then in ``plugin.py``, register your ``public`` directory with CKAN by calling
the :py:func:`~ckan.plugins.toolkit.add_public_directory` function. Add this
line to the :py:func:`~ckan.ckanext.example_theme.v11_extra_public_directory.plugin.update_config`
function:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v11_extra_public_directory/plugin.py
   :pyobject: ExampleThemePlugin.update_config

If you now browse to `127.0.0.1:5000/promoted-image.jpg <http://127.0.0.1:5000/promoted-image.jpg>`_,
you should see your image file.

To replace the image on the front page with your custom image, we need to
override the ``promoted.html`` template snippet. Create the following directory
and file::

 ckanext-example_theme/
   templates/
     home/
       snippets/
         promoted.html

Edit your new ``promoted.html`` snippet, and insert these contents:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v11_extra_public_directory/templates/home/snippets/promoted.html

After calling ``{% ckan_extends %}`` to declare that it extends (rather than
completely replaces) the default ``promoted.html`` snippet, this custom snippet
overrides two of ``promoted.html``'s template blocks. The first block replaces
the caption text of the promoted image. The second block replaces the ``<img>``
tag itself, pointing it at our custom static image file:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v11_extra_public_directory/templates/home/snippets/promoted.html
   :start-after: {# Replace the promoted image. #}

If you now reload the `CKAN front page`_ in your browser, you should see the
promoted image replaced with our custom one.


----------------------
Customizing CKAN's CSS
----------------------

Extensions can add their own CSS files to modify or extend CKAN's default CSS.
Create an ``example_theme.css`` file in your extension's ``public`` directory::

    ckanext-example_theme/
      public/
        example_theme.css

Add this CSS into the ``example_theme.css`` file, to change the color of CKAN's
"account masthead" (the bar across the top of the site that shows the logged-in
user's account info):

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v12_custom_css/public/example_theme.css

If your restart the development web server (kill the server using Ctrl-c, then
run the ``paster serve`` command again) you should be able to open this file at
http://127.0.0.1:5000/example_theme.css in a web browser.

To make CKAN use our custom CSS we need to override the ``base.html`` template,
this is the base template which the templates for all CKAN pages extend, so if
we include a CSS file in this base template then the file will be included in
every page of your CKAN site. Create the file::

    ckanext-example_theme/
      templates/
        base.html

and put this Jinja code in it:

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v12_custom_css/templates/base.html

The default ``base.html`` template defines a ``styles`` block which can be
extended to link to custom CSS files (any code in the styles block will appear
in the ``<head>`` of the HTML page).

Restart the development web server, and you should see the background color of
the account masthead change. This custom color should appear on all pages of
your CKAN site.

Now that we have CKAN using our CSS file, we can add more CSS rules to the file
and customize CKAN's CSS as much as we want. There's nothing special about CSS
in CKAN, you just use the usual tools and techniques to explore and hack the
CSS.

.. todo:: Link to some tools?

   e.g. Firefox inspector etc (or Chrome? Firebug?)

   e.g. Some online CSS reference.

Let's add a bit more code to our ``example_theme.css`` file. This CSS
implements a partial imitation of the `datahub.io <http://datahub.io/>`_ theme
(circa 2013):

.. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v13_more_custom_css/public/example_theme.css

.. todo::

   We use LESS for the CKAN core CSS. Do we want to mention that here?


.. _fanstatic tutorial:

------------------------------------------------
Adding |javascript| and CSS file using Fanstatic
------------------------------------------------

If you're adding |javascript| or CSS files to your theme, you can add them
using `Fanstatic <http://www.fanstatic.org/>`_ rather than the simple
:ref:`extra_public_paths` method described above (`JavaScript modules
<javascript modules>`_ *must* be added using Fanstatic). Using Fanstatic to add
|javascript| and CSS files allows you to take advantage of Fanstatic's
features, such as automatically serving minified files in production, caching
and bundling files together to reduce page load times, specifying dependencies
between files so that the files a page needs (and only the files it needs) are
always loaded, and other tricks to optimize page load times.

.. note::

   CKAN will only serve ``*.js`` and ``*.css`` files as Fanstatic resources,
   other types of static files (eg. image files, PDF files) must be added
   using the :ref:`extra_public_paths` method described above.

Adding a custom |javascript| or CSS file to CKAN is using Fanstatic is simple:

.. todo:: Turn this into a real working example.

1. First, create a fanstatic directory in your extension with the CSS and
   |javascript| files in it::

    ckanext-example_theme/
      fanstatic/
        my_style.css
        my_script.js

2. Use CKAN's ``add_resource()`` function to register your fanstatic
   directory with CKAN. Edit the ``update_config()`` method in your
   ``plugin.py`` file::

        def update_config(self, config):

            # Add this plugin's templates dir to CKAN's extra_template_paths, so
            # that CKAN will use this plugin's custom templates.
            toolkit.add_template_directory(config, 'templates')

            # Add this plugin's public dir to CKAN's extra_public_paths, so
            # that CKAN will use this plugin's custom static files.
            toolkit.add_public_directory(config, 'public')

            toolkit.add_resource('fanstatic', 'example_theme')

   The second argument to ``add_resource()``, ``'example_theme'``, is the name
   that you'll need to use to refer to your custom Fanstatic library from
   templates (you can pass whatever name you want here).

3. Finally, use CKAN's custom Jinja2 tag ``{% resource %}`` to import the file
   in the template that needs it::

     {% resource 'example_theme/my_script.js' %}
     {% resource 'example_theme/my_style.css' %}

   You can put the ``{% resource %}`` tag anywhere in the template, and
   Fanstatic will insert and necessary ``<style>`` and ``<script>`` tags to
   include your |javascript| and CSS files and their dependencies in the right
   places in the HTML output (CSS files in the HTML ``<head>``, |javascript|
   files at the bottom of the page).

.. todo:: Add a note about Fanstatic resource configuration file.

.. _javascript modules:

-----------------------------
Customizing CKAN's JavaScript
-----------------------------

.. todo:: Link to an introductory JavaScript tutorial.

.. todo:: Introduce the example we're doing here: starring datasets using a
     custom dataset_star action (also need the code to add this action).

.. todo:: Explain that Bootstrap's JavaScript features can be used just by CSS.


Initializing a JavaScript module
================================

To get CKAN to call some custom JavaScript code, we need to:

1. Implement a |javascript| module, and register it with CKAN.
   Create the file ``ckanext-example_theme/fanstatic/favorite.js``, with these
   contents:

   .. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v14_initialize_a_javascript_module/fanstatic/favorite.js

   This bit of |javascript| calls the ``ckan.module()`` function to register a
   new JavaScript module with CKAN. ``ckan.module()`` takes two arguments: the
   name of the module being registered (``'favorite'`` in this example) and a
   function that returns the module itself. The function takes two arguments,
   which we'll look at later. The module is just a |javascript| object with a
   single attribute, ``initialize``, whose value is a function that CKAN will
   call to initialize the module. In this example, the initialize function just
   prints out a confirmation message - this |javascript| module doesn't do
   anything interesting yet.

2. Include the |javascript| module in a page, using Fanstatic, and apply it to
   one or more HTML elements on that page. We'll override CKAN's
   ``package_item.html`` template snippet to insert our module whenever a
   package is rendered as part of a list of packages (for example, on the
   dataset search page). Create the file
   ``ckanext-example_theme/templates/snippets/package_item.html`` with these
   contents:

   .. literalinclude:: ../ckanext/example_theme/v14_initialize_a_javascript_module/templates/snippets/package_item.html

   .. todo:: Link to something about HTML data-* attributes.

   If you now restart the development server and open
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/dataset in your web browser, you should see an
   extra "star this dataset" button next to each dataset shown. If you open a
   |javascript| console in your browser, you should see the message that your
   module has printed out.

   .. todo:: Link to something about JavaScript consoles.

   If you have more than one dataset on your page, you'll see the module's
   message printed once for each dataset. The ``package_item.html`` template
   snippet is rendered once for each dataset that's shown in the list, and
   CKAN creates a new instance of your |javascript| module for each dataset.
   If you view the source of your page, however, you'll see that
   ``favorite.js`` is only included with a ``<script>`` tag once. Fanstatic
   is smart enough to deduplicate resources.

   .. note:: |javascript| modules *must* be included as Fanstatic resources,
      you can't add them to a ``public`` directory and include them using your
      own ``<script>`` tags.

.. Link to some JavaScript tutorial?

   JavaScript modules are the core - every javascripted object should be a
   module. Small, isolated components that can be easily tested. They should
   not use any global objects, all functionality provided to them via a sandbox
   object.

   A module is a JavaScript object with an initialize() and a teardown()
   method.

   Initialize a module with a data-module attribute:
     <select name="format" data-module="autocomplete"></select>

   Or apparently you can also use {% resource %}? Or you have to use resource?

   "favorite" module goes in favorite.js file.

   The idea is that the HTML element should still work fine is JavaScript is
   disabled - e.g. use form submission instead of XHR request.

   You can pass "options objects" with further data-module-* attributes.

   The modules are initialized "on DOM ready", each module's initialize()
   method is called.

   this.sandbox.jQuery - access jQuery methods
   this.sandbox.translte() - i18n
   (or these are the jQuery and _ params of your module function)

   pub/sub for sending messages between modules:
   this.sandbox.publish/subscribe/unsubscribe

   this.sandbox.client should be used to make XHR requests to the CKAN API
   (not jQuery.ajax())

   i18n: this.sandbox.translate(), supports %(name)s, including plurals.
   The options() method of each module should set all strings to be i18n'd?
   Then other code uses this.18n() to retrieve them.

   If not CKAN specific, module functionality should be packaged up in jQuery
   plugins.

   Testing.
