Welcome to CKAN's Administration Guide

* The first two sections cover your two options for installing CKAN: package or source install.
* The rest of the first half of the Guide, up to :doc:`authorization`, cover setup and basic admin. 
* The second half of the Guide, from :doc:`extensions` onwards, covers advanced tasks, including extensions and forms.
