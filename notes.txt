Notes for per-package-type behaviour.

 - I don't really know where the best place to create the mappings from
   package-types to plugin instances is.  At the moment, I'm creating the
   mapping just prior to the package routing stuff in routing.py.

 - I've assumed package-type is a string.  If it's not then only the docs
   need to change (as long as it's some hashable value anyway).

 - Running the tests seems to be involing the routing.py more than once.  I
   haven't looked into why this is.  Running the server seems to work fine
   thuough.
